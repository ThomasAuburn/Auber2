 * NPCs use nodes to walk around and A* to navigate between them, the nodes are generated and stored in GraphCreator, while MapGraph is used to search and manipulate the node graph
 * Generally, NPCs are updated through updateNPC, which calls each npcs step method, which makes them moves, sets their sprite scale, checks if they have reached the next node etc
 * Crewmember is very simple, they walk around randomly and wait for a random amount of time
 * Infiltrator is more complex, they sometimes go to destroy keysystems, and can use abilities
